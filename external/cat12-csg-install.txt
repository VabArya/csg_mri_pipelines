After placing cat12 folder in your spm12/toolbox folder, please also enable expert gui mode by opening cat_defaults.m and setting cat.extopts.expertgui    = 1;
This will allow you to open the CAT12 batch files and see all the parameters.
If SPM was already launched at least once in the current MATLAB session, please close and reopen a new MATLAB window (and not just SPM) to get the expert options to display (in particular, White Matter Hyperintensities Correction WMHC).
